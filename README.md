# PokéShuffler

Catch Pokémon and manage them in your Pokédex.
Built with ReactJS and [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

Generate a randomized Pokémon by pressing the `Shuffle Button`.\
Catch the current Pokémon by hitting the `Pokéball Button`.\
Once a Pokémon is caught, you will unlock the `Pokédex Button` to view and manage all caught Pokémon.

Pokédex data is stored via `LocalStorage` for your convenience. Good luck catching 'em all!
